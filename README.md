# Learn the alphabet

A simple website to help children learn the alphabet!

My daughter has been learning how to read, and whilst she loves playing with my iPad, there isn't a website where she can just learn letters. This is the website. There's nothing you can click out of, so it's safe to put on a phone or tablet in kiosk/locked mode, and let your child click away at the letters.

Not much more to it than that. Bits and bobs of code (mostly JavaScript) taken from bits and bobs of the internet - see the source code for full attribution.
